Owners of loaned equipment may be asked to relocate or remove the equipment at any 
time at the sole expense of the owner(s). The owner(s) agree that if the Board of Directors 
does not receive a response to a written or electronic request to relocate or remove the 
equipment within 30 days, the property will be considered abandoned by the 
owner(s) and will become the property of i3Detroit, and may thereafter be modified, 
discarded or  transferred to another party by the Board of Directors.
